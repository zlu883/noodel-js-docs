                    <h4>About Noodel</h4>
                    <p>
                        Noodel - which stands for <i>node view model</i> - is a beautiful, dynamic user interface for
                        digital content. It offers a way to present content that is modern, intuitive, and adaptable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Noodel is currently available as Noodel.js, an open source JavaScript library for use in
                        web-based
                        projects.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="node">
                    <h4>How it works</h4>
                    <p>
                        Noodel requires you to arrange your content into a tree of nodes, where each node contains a
                        distinct chunk of content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your content tree will be presented on an infinite canvas that you can navigate by simply
                        moving up, down, left and right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blocks of content will show or hide as you move through the tree, keeping only the relevant
                        subtree visible. Think of it like an infinite cascade of drop-down menus - but much more elegant
                        and useful.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="node">
                    <h4>Why Noodel?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As websites and applications grow larger and more complicated, so too will UI features provided
                        for
                        navigation - like table of contents, menus and sidebars. However, these components add clutter
                        to the UI, and are generally hard to use on small screens and touch devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Noodel is a system designed from the ground up that aims to present content in a <i>better</i>
                        way. Originally intended as an idea for navigating tree hierarchies, it has evolved to become
                        an incredibly versatile system for displaying content in general. Inspired by the "right =
                        enter, left = exit"
                        paradigm of UI design, as well as 4-way swipe motions that are increasingly utilised by mobile
                        apps,
                        Noodel allows you to integrate navigation with the content organically without requiring any
                        extra UI components.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="node">
                    <h4>What can I use it for?</h4>
                    <p>
                        At the maximum, you can use Noodel to present a full website or app as an interactive
                        content tree. It can be used for virtually anything - from static blogs or wikis, to dynamic
                        apps with complex control flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the minimum, you can use Noodel as a versatile UI plugin for responsive slideshows or
                        hierachical data.

                        <h5>😃 Intuitive</h5>
                        <p>
                            Noodel is simple and intuitive. Most people immediately understand how it works. It
                            aims to leverage the user's spatial memory for navigation, and reduce screen clutter and
                            cognitive
                            load.

                        <p>
                            Noodel's layout and navigation mechanism remains identical
                            regardless of screen size and input method. By reducing the essential controls to 4-way
                            movements, it can be easily used in contexts where control ability is limited.

                            Everything about Noodel is designed to be flexible - from its fully customizable styles
                            and layout, to what kind of content you can put in.

                            Noodel is more than just a static content viewer, although you can certainly use it that
                            way. It provides an extensive API with navigation methods and getters, and allows you to
                            insert, update or delete nodes at any time.

                        <p>
                            Noodel is built with performance in mind using modern best practices. It uses the
                            powerful <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> library
                            under the hood for DOM management and updates.

                            movie?
                            Noodel is responsive, interactive and comes with fancy animation effects. It's
                            just cool.

                    <h5>Node</h5>
                    <p>
                        The container for a unit of content in Noodel is called a <i>node</i> - just like the one
                        you're looking at right now. Nodes are the basic building blocks for your content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each node can have one or more ordered child nodes
                        that have their own units of sub-content. This can repeat infinitely to form a tree of any size.
                    </p>
                    <div class="node">
                        <p>
                            Noodel encourages you to break down large blocks of content into smaller
                            chunks, which is generally good for readability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A node should never exceed the size of the viewport - a precondition for node-based
                            navigation.

                        A <i>noodel</i> (i.e. node view model) refers to the whole content tree formed by nodes.

                        The descendants of the active child will be shown while the others hidden.

                        of active nodes starting from the root are shown. This tree of visible
                        content is called the <i>active tree</i>.

                            In other words, a branch refers to a node's list of children.
                            Each branch is always uniquely associated with a node - the parent node of the branch.

                        The root node is an invisible node that serves as the parent of the topmost branch
                        (i.e. the root of the tree), and always exists.

                        The level refers to the depth of a node (or branch) in the tree. The root node has level 0,
                        its children (and branch) has level 1, and so on.

                            Noodel comes with a "core" stylesheet, <code class="language-html">noodel.css</code>,

                            The core stylesheet contains styles critical for
                            Noodel's functioning and needs to be included in all cases.

                        <p>
                            The theming stylesheet provides a default grayscale theme
                            with basic transitions for Noodel's visual effects. You can include this stylesheet
                            and tweak it for customization, or replace it altogether with your
                            own custom theme. See <a href="#styling-summary">Styling</a> for more details.

                            For sites driven by static HTML templates, you can define the tree via HTML and

                                Noodel will traverse the descendants of the container element and convert
                                all <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s with
                                <code class="language-html">class="node"</code> into
                                Noodel's nodes, keeping the parent-child relationships. Any text or
                                elements inside a node that are not child nodes will be treated as the
                                <i>content</i> of that node, concatenated in the order they appear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This concatenation preserves the markup of the content elements
                                so you have complete freedom in structuring and styling the content
                                of each node.
                            </p>

                                Note that the actual DOM nodes in the definition will not be placed into Noodel's
                                element tree.
                                This means that side effects such as event listeners attached to them will not be
                                carried over.

                        <h4>Preventing navigation</h4>
                        <p>
                            By default, a noodel responds to four types of user input for navigation:
                            swipe(drag), keyboard, scroll wheel, and tap. Navigation will occur even
                            when such input originates from content elements inside nodes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This behaviour can be undesirable when you have UI elements that should
                            capture those inputs and prevent them from causing navigation, e.g. a slider
                            or a textbox.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Prevention classes</h4>
                        <p>
                            To address this issue, Noodel provides the following "prevention classes" that you can
                            selectively apply to individual elements in your content:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-swipe</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-key</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-wheel</code></li>
                            <li><code class="language-html">nd-prevent-tap</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Noodel will ignore the input that originates from an element (or its descendants) with
                            the corresponding prevention class and stops it from triggering any Noodel-specific
                            behaviour.

                            You should use prevention classes sparingly, on elements that really need them. Having large
                            blocks of content with navigation prevention may impact usability, especially on smaller
                            screens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For situations that require extensive navigation prevention, you should rely on the
                            <a href="#inspect-mode-summary">inspect mode</a>
                            instead. Alternatively, you can disable the corresponding input in Noodel's options and
                            provide your own means of navigation via Noodel's API.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p>
                            For swipe-based interfaces such as Noodel, there is always an unavoidable conflict between
                            the swipe mechanism and native mechanisms that depend on the same motion, such as text
                            selection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <i>inspect mode</i> is the solution Noodel offers to address this issue. By default,
                            text selection is disabled on a noodel and all input directed towards navigation.
                            Once inspect mode is on, all navigation methods will
                            be suspended and the user is free to select text or perform other conflicting interactions
                            e.g. drag-and-drop in the focal node.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is recommended that you rely on inspect mode, in addition to <a
                                href="#prevention-class">prevention classes</a>, to deal with situations
                            where UI elements in your content conflict with Noodel's mechanism.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="node">
                        <h4>Inspect mode trigger</h4>
                        <p>
                            The default trigger for inspect mode is the double tap (on any area of the noodel), or the
                            Enter key on a keyboard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This trigger is chosen for maximum convenience and compatibility, but like
                            anything else it does end up conflicting
                            with interactions such as multiple clicks to select a word/line. If you wish to prevent the

                        <p>
                            The inspect mode is also used for viewing overflow content in nodes.
                            Scrolling inside nodes is disabled normally but enabled during inspect mode.

                        <p>
                            Noodel is based on the principle of content chunking. Because
                            each node has a limited space, as a general rule, you should try to break down
                            large blocks of content into bite-sized pieces that can fit into individual nodes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this can be impractical in many situations, so inspect mode is provided as a
                            fallback for viewing overflow content.

                            The object instance you get when you create a noodel is its "view model". You
                            can also obtain the view model of individual nodes via methods on the noodel
                            instance.

                        <p>
                            These view models have 2-way sync with the view, and provide extensive API
                            methods for you to dynamically query and update almost every aspect of the content tree.

                                Each view model of a node is uniquely associated with a node in the tree.
                                This means you can do things such as compare the equality of two nodes by simply
                                comparing the reference of their view model objects.

                                Noodel will always try to preserve the current focal node during

                                that if the current focal node is at index 3, and you insert a node at index 1,
                                the focal node becomes the node at index 4, and no navigation will occur.

                            When using Noodel's API, all changes to Noodel's <i>view model</i> are synchronous,
                            while any DOM updates triggered by these changes will be asynchronous. This means that,
                            if you need to do operations that depends on the updated DOM state, you must
                            wait for the updates to settle before doing so.

                            The <code class="language-js">nextTick()</code> function is Noodel's preferred
                            way to wait for DOM updates to fully complete and settle.
                            One common use case is to wait for the view to mount before querying a DOM element:

                            bottom, and "reverse" the opposite. When the trunk axis is the vertical axis,
                            "normal" puts nodes from left to right, and "reverse" the opposite.

                        <p>
                            The focal offsets specify the "snap-to lines" on the canvas where the focal branch and
                            active nodes align to, on their respective axis. These are calculated as a function of the canvas length,
                            and defaults to 1/2 of the canvas length (i.e. the center).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The anchor offsets specify the "snap-to lines" on each branch/node that should be aligned to
                            the focal offset, on their respective axis, when they become focal or active.
                            These are calculated as a function of the length of the branch/node,
                            and defaults to 1/2 of their length (i.e. the center). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These offsets can be specified globally
                            and/or customized on each individual node.
                            When used in combination, you can decide how and where the branches and nodes align in a
                            highly flexible way.

                                depending on the orientation and branch direction. E.g. For an ltr layout
                                with normal branch direction, the origin for the trunk axis is the left edge
                                and the origin for the branch axis is the top edge. For an rtl layout
                                with reverse branch direction, the origin for the trunk axis is the right edge
                                and the origin for the branch axis is the bottom edge.

                                viewport size changed.
                                Since this is a more expensive operation it should be used carefully.

                        <p>
                            Noodel has a routing capability which is enabled by default. This allows Noodel to control
                            the hash of your URL to sync with the location of the current focal node.
                            It will use the ID of the focal node as the fragment identifier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This allows you to use the browser's history navigation to jump between nodes, as well
                            as create URL links that target specific nodes in a noodel.
                        </p>
                        <div class="node">
                            <p>
                                If routing is enabled at a noodel's creation, it will check the URL to jump to
                                an initial focal node if its ID is equal to the hash. The sync between the focal node
                                and the URL hash happens regardless whether the noodel is mounted.

                        <h4>History push behavior</h4>
                        <p>
                            Only explicit changes to the URL (e.g. by clicking on a link) will cause a new entry to be
                            pushed to the browser history. Noodel uses
                            <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState
                                target="_blank">history.replaceState()</a>
                            to replace the URL hash as you navigate around the noodel to prevent creating
                            too many unnecessary entries. This includes when you use Noodel's API to navigate.

                                If you need to do a programmatic navigation that pushes to the history stack, you
                                should change the URL hash to point to the target node instead of using
                                Noodel's API.

                        <p>
                            You should use routing on one noodel per page only (ideally, when you use a single noodel
                            to control a site). Routing behaviour for multiple
                            noodels on the same page is not well defined.

                            Due to the fact that Noodel does not use native scrolling for its navigation, basic Ctrl+F search
                            in browsers will not be able to jump to individual occurrences. You may need to implement your
                            own search function for your noodel.

                            You can control most aspects of Noodel's appearance using plain CSS, by extending/overriding
                            Noodel's CSS classes, or by setting custom class/styles on individual nodes.

                        <p>
                            Noodel comes with a "core" stylesheet that determines the layout, and a theming stylesheet
                            with a default theme. While you must keep the core stylesheet, you can override or
                            replace the CSS rules in the theming stylesheet as you see fit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of Noodel's DOM elements have various built-in CSS classes attached dynamically.
                            See <a href="#css_classes">CSS classes</a> for the list of classes you can
                            work with.

                            You can specify custom class/styles for each node that will be applied to the
                            <code class="language-css">nd-node</code> element. This is useful when you need

                        <p>
                            The size of nodes are completely flexible - they are simply placed in a
                            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flex container</a>,
                            and will grow or shrink to fit their content while respecting any CSS rules applied.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means you can control the size of nodes by specifying their various height, width
                            and flex properties. In addition, you can style your content
                            and let them influence the size of their node containers.

                            the duration and timing functions of all animations via CSS overrides of the corresponding
                            classes.

                        <p>
                            Enter/leave animations make use of the <a

                            You can apply any combination of them according to your needs.

                        <p>
                            Movement animations use transitions of the CSS transform property. These should be specified
                            on the nd-xxx-move classes for the corresponding element, and should only be specified
                            on these classes. The move classes are always attached on their elements and temporarily
                            removed when necessary to disable transform transitions.

                            Noodel uses Vue.js internally and hence provides integration with Vue out of the box.
                            Noodel is available as a Vue component, and also allows you to use Vue components
                            as the content for individual nodes.
                        </p>

                    <div class="node">
                        <h4>Using the Vue-less build</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you are including Noodel and Vue's scripts directly in your
                            HTML, it is recommended that you use Noodel's <a href="#vueless-build">Vue-less
                                build</a>, alongside the Vue script used in your main project (Noodel requires Vue V3).
                            This prevents Vue from being included twice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are using Noodel via a bundler, the default entry is the Vue-less build
                            and the bundler should be able to take care of bundling Vue as a dependency.
                        </p>

                                Noodel only needs Vue's runtime script. If you need to compile templates in runtime
                                you need to include Vue's compiler script separately.

                        <h4>Using Noodel's Vue component</h4>
                        <p>
                            Noodel's Vue component is exposed as a static variable on the Noodel class, which can be
                            used like any other Vue components. The way to use it is as follows:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            <code class="language-js">
                                import Noodel from 'noodel';
                                import { createApp } from 'vue';

                                const NoodelComponent = Noodel.VueComponent;                            
                                const app = createApp({
                                    component: {
                                        NoodelComponent
                                    },
                                    template: '&lt;NoodelComponent :noodel="noodel.getState()"/&gt;',
                                    data: {
                                        noodel: new Noodel([])
                                    }
                                });
                                
                                app.mount("#el");
                            </code> 
                        </pre>
                        <div class="node">
                            <p>
                                Noodel's Vue component takes a single prop, <i>noodel</i>, which must be the internal
                                state tree of a Noodel instance that you can obtain via <code
                                    class="language-js">getState()</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is important that you do not modify this state tree yourself, but instead use the API
                                methods provided on the Noodel instance to do so.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="node">
                            <p>
                                You are not required to register the Noodel instance as reactive data. However, there is
                                no harm
                                in doing so (like in the example) if it suits how you manage your state in your Vue
                                project.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="node">

                                or <code class="language-js">unmount()</code> when using Noodel
                                as a Vue component. It is simply a component that gets mounted and unmounted with your
                                Vue instance.
                            </p>

                        <h4>Using Vue components as node content</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can pass Vue components as node content and they will be rendered via Vue's dynamic
                            component feature, i.e.
                            <code
                                class="language-markup">&lt;component :is="yourComponent"&gt;&lt;/component&gt;</code>.
                            To do so, you need to provide an object as node content:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
                            const noodel = new Noodel([
                                {
                                    content: {
                                        component: YourVueComponent, // your Vue component reference
                                        props: { // name-value pairs of props to pass to this component
                                            "propA": "abc",
                                            "propB": 20
                                        },
                                        eventListeners: { // name-value pairs of event listeners to attach onto the component
                                            "onButtonClick": () => console.log("button click")
